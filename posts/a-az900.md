# 1. Core Fundamental Concepts



### 1.0.1. Cloud Computing
The practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer. These remote servers are owned by big technology companies called: the cloud provider (Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform..)

### 1.0.2. Microsoft Azure
Azure is a continually expanding set of cloud services that help your organization meet your current and future business challenges providing more than 100 services that enable you to do everything from running your existing applications on virtual machines, to exploring new software paradigms, such as intelligent bots and mixed reality.

### 1.0.3. Cloud Computing Advantages
There are several advantages that a cloud environment has over a physical environment that a company can use following its migration to Azure.

**High availability:** Depending on the service-level agreement (SLA) that you choose, your cloud-based apps can provide a continuous user experience with no apparent downtime, even when things go wrong.

**Scalability:** Apps in the cloud can scale vertically, and horizontally respectively: Increase compute capacity by adding RAM or CPUs to a virtual machine, Increase compute capacity by adding instances of resources, such as adding VMs to the configuration.
    
**Elasticity:** You can configure cloud-based apps to take advantage of autoscaling, so your apps always have the resources they need.

**Agility:** Deploy and configure cloud-based resources quickly as your app requirements change.

**Geo-distribution:** You can deploy apps and data to regional datacenters around the globe, thereby ensuring that your customers always have the best performance in their region.

**Disaster recovery:** By taking advantage of cloud-based backup services, data replication, and geo-distribution, you can deploy your apps with the confidence that comes from knowing that your data is safe in the event of disaster.

### 1.0.4. CAPEX VS OPEX
There are two different types of expenses that you should consider:

**Capital Expenditures (CAPEX)** are major purchases a company makes to acquire, upgrade, and maintain physical assets that are designed to be used over the long term. 
**Operating Expenditures (OPEX)** are the day-to-day expenses a company incurs to keep its business operational.

### 1.0.5. Cloud computing is a consumption-based model
This **pay-as-you-go** model means usage is metered and you pay only for what you consume. The fundamental economics of cloud computing are based around the premise that customers will pay for how long a server is used, or how much bandwidth data is being consumed.

## 1.1. Cloud Models
**Public Cloud** is cloud computing that’s delivered via the internet and shared across organizations. Cloud resources, such as servers and storage, are owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider, Azure in our case.

**Private Cloud** is cloud computing that is dedicated solely to your organization. A private cloud can be physically located at your organization's on-site (on-premises) datacenter, or it can be hosted by a third-party service provider.

**Hybrid Cloud** is any environment that uses both public and private clouds by allowing data and applications to be shared between them.

### 1.1.1. Cloud Model Comparison
<img src="/images/AZ900STUFF/Model-Comparison.png"
     alt="models"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />  <br/>
     <br/>
 

## 1.2. Cloud Service Models
Cloud computing is offered in three different service models which each satisfy a unique set of business requirements.


 <img src="/images/AZ900STUFF/SharedResponsability.png"
     alt="responsibility  "
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />  <br/>
     <br/>
      

 **1) Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**  is also known as Hardware as a service. It is the most flexible category of cloud services. It aims to give you complete control over the hardware that runs your application. Instead of buying hardware, with IaaS, you rent it.

 **2) Platform as a Service (PaaS)** is created for the programmer to develop, test, run, and manage the applications.This service provides the same benefits and considerations as IaaS, but there are some additional benefits to be aware of.

**3) Software as a service** is also known as "on-demand software". It is a software in which the applications are hosted by a cloud service provider. Users can access these applications with the help of internet connection and web browser.

<img src="/images/AZ900STUFF/daservicemodels.png"
     alt="servicemodels  "
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" /> 
      <br/>


### 1.2.2. Serverless Computing  
Like PaaS, Serverless is a cloud-native development model that allows developers to build and run applications without having to manage servers. There are still servers in serverless, but they are abstracted away from app development. You will know about serverless below while discussing Azure Core Solution.

## 1.3. Azure Architectural Components
<img src="/images/AZ900STUFF/Mgroups.png"
     alt="Mgroups  "
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" /> 
      <br/>


**Resources:** Resources are instances of services that you create, like virtual machines, storage, or SQL databases.
**Resource groups:** Resources are combined into resource groups, which act as a logical container into which Azure resources like web apps, databases, and storage accounts are deployed and managed.
**Subscriptions:** A subscription groups together user accounts and the resources that have been created by those user accounts. For each subscription, there are limits or quotas on the amount of resources that you can create and use. Organizations can use subscriptions to manage costs and the resources that are created by users, teams, or projects.
**Management groups:** These groups help you manage access, policy, and compliance for multiple subscriptions. All subscriptions in a management group automatically inherit the conditions applied to the management group.

#### 1.3.0.1. Azure Region
A region is a geographical area on the planet that contains at least one but potentially multiple datacenters that are nearby and networked together with a low-latency network. Azure intelligently assigns and controls the resources within each region to ensure workloads are appropriately balanced.

#### 1.3.0.2. Availability Zone
Availability zones are physically separate datacenters within an Azure region. Each availability zone is made up of one or more datacenters equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking. An availability zone is set up to be an isolation boundary. If one zone goes down, the other continues working. Availability zones are connected through high-speed, private fiber-optic networks.

#### 1.3.0.3. Azure Region Pairs
Availability zones are created by using one or more datacenters. There's a minimum of three zones within a single region. It's possible that a large disaster could cause an outage big enough to affect even two datacenters. That's why Azure also creates region pairs.

#### 1.3.0.4. Azure Availability Zones
You want to ensure your services and data are redundant so you can protect your information in case of failure. When you host your infrastructure, setting up your own redundancy requires that you create duplicate hardware environments. Azure can help make your app highly available through availability zones.

### 1.3.1. Interact with Microsoft Azure
**Azure Portal:** Simply a graphical user interface to work with Microsof Azure.
**Azure Resource Manager:** Another way to interact in a declarative way: Microsoft Infrastructure as a code tool, used only for Azure resources.

<img src="/images/AZ900STUFF/sla.png"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" /> 
      <br/>
Performance targets above 99.99 percent are very difficult to achieve. An SLA of 99.99 percent means 1 minute of downtime per week. It's difficult for humans to respond to failures quickly enough to meet SLA performance targets above 99.99 percent. Instead, your application must be able to self-diagnose and self-heal during an outage.      

**Why are SLAs important?** Understanding the SLA for each Azure service you use helps you understand what guarantees you can expect. When you build applications on Azure, the availability of the services that you use affect your application's performance. Understanding the SLAs involved can help you establish the SLA you set with your customers.

**Note: to find the SLA of a combinaison of services, you make the sum.**
 **99.9% × 99.9% × 99.99% × 99.99% = 0.999 × 0.999 × 0.9999 × 0.9999 = 0.9978 = 99.78%**

### 12.0.1. What Is The Service Lifecycle?
The service lifecycle defines how every Azure service is released for public use.
Every Azure service starts in the development phase. In this phase, the Azure team collects and defines its requirements, and begins to build the service.

### 12.0.2. Types of Previews
 There are two types of previews, **private and public**. The private preview is only available to certain Azure customers for evaluation purposes. The public preview is available to all Azure customers.
