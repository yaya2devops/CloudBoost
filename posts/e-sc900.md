## 0.1. Motivation
      
Security fosters situational awareness and maintains equilibrium. Without security, people become complacent and overlook unusual behavior by civilians, employees, and others around them. Security guides a positive and proactive culture because awareness is an ongoing activity and people want to do the right thing.

Choosing this exam is critical regardless of your primary interest in the cloud. You will require security despite of where you are and having that knowledge will help you advance. An introduction to security that will assist you in grasping some interesting cybersecurity concepts ranging from the fundamentals to some principles used when moving to the cloud such as the Zero Trust Model.

# Foundation Concepts

## Security

**What is Security?** The goal of computer security is to protect a single machine and the data stored on it. Security is defined as being free from danger, attacks, or feeling safe.


It is essential to comprehend these terms because the following information will be derived from them.

### Encryption
Encryption is the process of converting information into a secret code that conceals the true meaning of the information. Cryptography is the science of encrypting and decrypting information. Unencrypted data is referred to as plaintext in computing, while encrypted data is referred to as ciphertext.

### Hashing
Hashing is the process of generating a value from a text or a list of numbers using a hash function, which is a mathematical function. A Hash Function is a function that transforms a numeric or alphanumeric key into a small practical integer value. In the hash table, the mapped integer value serves as an index.

### Shared Responsibility Model
The shared responsibility model, as mentioned in previous exams, identifies which security tasks are handled by the cloud provider and which security tasks are handled by you, the customer. The duties differ depending on where the workload is hosted:

- Software as a Service (SaaS) 
- Platform as a Service (PaaS) 
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) 
- Datacenter on-premises

#### Datacenters located on-site
You are responsible for everything in an on-premises datacenter, from physical security to encrypting sensitive data.

#### Infrastructure as a Service 
IaaS is the cloud service that requires the most management from the cloud customer. You use the cloud provider's computing infrastructure when you use IaaS. The cloud customer is not responsible for the physical components of the datacenter, such as computers, networks, or physical security. The cloud customer is still responsible for software components such as operating systems, network controls, applications, and data security.

#### Platform as a Service
PaaS is a platform for developing, testing, and deploying software applications. The goal of PaaS is to allow you to quickly create an application without having to manage the underlying infrastructure. The cloud provider manages the hardware and operating systems in PaaS, while the customer is responsible for the applications and data.

#### Software as a Service
The cloud provider hosts and manages SaaS for the customer. It is typically licensed on a monthly or annual basis. SaaS software includes Microsoft 365, Skype, and Dynamics CRM Online. SaaS necessitates the least amount of management on the part of the cloud customer. Except for data, devices, accounts, and identities, the cloud provider is in charge of everything.

### Defense In Depth
Defense in depth is a security strategy that employs multiple security measures to safeguard an organization's assets. The theory is that if one line of defense is breached, additional layers of defense exist as a backup to ensure that threats are stopped along the way. Defense in depth addresses the security flaws that exist not only in hardware and software, but also in people, as negligence or human error are frequently the cause of a security breach.

Layers of security examples include:
- Physical security measures include restricting access to a datacenter to authorized personnel only.
- Control access to infrastructure and change control using identity and access security controls such as multifactor authentication or conditional access.
- Your corporate network's perimeter security includes distributed denial of service (DDoS) protection to filter large-scale attacks before they cause a denial of service for users.
- To limit communication between resources, network security measures such as network segmentation and network access controls are used.
- Compute layer security includes closing specific ports to secure access to virtual machines on-premises or in the cloud.
- Application layer security ensures that applications are secure and free of security flaws.
- Controls to manage access to business and customer data, as well as encryption to protect data, are all part of data layer security.

#### What about CIA 
All of the various mechanisms (technologies, processes, and training) are components of a cybersecurity strategy, the goals of which include ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

- Confidentiality: One of the fundamental concepts of cybersecurity is confidentiality. Simply put, confidentiality protects confidential information from unauthorized disclosure. Confidentiality is a shared responsibility for technologists and everyone else in the organization. As well as preserving authorized restrictions on access and disclosure, including means for protecting personal privacy and proprietary information.
- Integrity: The integrity of your system means that data or information in your system is not modified or deleted by unauthorized parties. This is a critical component of data hygiene, reliability, and accuracy. Its main objective is to make sure that a data will stay undamaged its all life cycle and will be the same where ever it can be not to cause any disturbance to information.
- Availability: refers to making data available to those who require it at the time they require it. It is critical for the organization to keep customer data secure, but it must also be accessible to employees who deal with customers. While it may be more secure to store data in encrypted form, employees must have access to unencrypted data.


### Zero Trust model
#### Overview
Zero Trust is a cybersecurity strategy that secures an organization by removing implicit trust and continuously validating every stage of a digital interaction. Zero Trust assumes that everything is on an open and untrusted network, including resources behind corporate firewalls. The Zero Trust model follows the tenet of "trust no one, verify everything."

#### Guiding Principles
- Verify explicitly: Always authenticate and authorize based on the data points available, such as user identity, location, device, service or workload, data classification, and anomalies.
- Least privileged access: To protect both data and productivity, limit user access with just-in-time and just-enough access (JIT/JEA), risk-based adaptive policies, and data protection.
- Assume breach: Access can be divided into network, user, device, and application segments. Encrypt data, and use analytics to gain visibility, detect threats, and improve security.

A security strategy that applies the three Zero Trust model principles across the six foundational pillars assists businesses in delivering and enforcing security across their organization.

#### Foundational pillars
1- Users, services, and devices can all have identities. When an identity attempts to access a resource, it must be verified using strong authentication and the principles of least privilege access.

2- As data flows from devices to on-premises workloads and the cloud, devices create a large attack surface. Devices that monitor health and compliance are an important aspect of security.

3- Data is consumed through applications. This includes identifying all applications in use, which is sometimes referred to as Shadow IT because not all applications are managed centrally. This pillar also includes permissions and access management.

4- Based on its attributes, data should be classified, labeled, and encrypted. Finally, security efforts are about protecting data and ensuring that it remains secure when it leaves devices, applications, infrastructure, and networks under the organization's control.

5- Infrastructure, whether on-premises or in the cloud, is a threat vector. You assess for version, configuration, and JIT access to improve security, and you use telemetry to detect attacks and anomalies. This enables you to automatically block or flag dangerous behavior and take protective measures.

6- Networks should be segmented, including in-network micro segmentation at a deeper level. Real-time threat protection, end-to-end encryption, monitoring, and analytics should also be used.




## Compliance
**What is Compliance? According to the Cambridge Dictionary, compliance is "the act of obeying an order, rule, or request." As per Wikipedia, "compliance" means "conforming to a rule, such as a specification, policy, standard, or law." 

Compliance is the state of being in accordance with established guidelines or specifications, or the process of becoming so.
Organizations can be held accountable for meeting dozens of regulations, ranging from personal and financial information to data protection and privacy, in order to be compliant. The following are some key concepts and terms related to data compliance.

#### Data residency
Data residency laws require companies doing business in a country to keep data about its citizens on servers in that country. Companies with customers or employees in multiple countries may find regulatory requirements onerous and difficult to meet.

#### Data sovereignty  
Data sovereignty entails maintaining control over encryption and data access. This prevents sensitive data from falling into the hands of a foreign entity without express permission, resulting in non-compliance with country-specific data sovereignty laws.

#### Data privacy
A privacy-compliant organization has strong administrative, technical, and physical security safeguards in place to ensure data confidentiality, integrity, and availability. This includes the ability to detect and prevent unauthorized or inappropriate data access.


## Identity

**What's Identity?**  who you are, the way you think about yourself, the way you are viewed by the world and the characteristics that define you. The same logic applies to determining your digital identity.

### Authentication

### Authorization

###  Identity as the primary security perimeter

### Four pillars of an identity infrastructure
