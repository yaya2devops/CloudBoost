### Connectors
#### Data Source types:
- Tabular data source: It is one that returns data in a structured table format.
- Function-based data: A function-based data source is one that uses functions to interact with the data source.

**Connectors** are the bridges from your data source to your app, workflow, or dashboard. Microsoft Power Platform has more than 600 connectors available to common data sources.
Examples of popular connectors include Salesforce, Office 365, Twitter, Dropbox, Google services, and more.
### Microsoft Dataverse
A Dataverse is essentially an online database or data warehouse that pulls in and stores data from multiple sources. This data can then be accessed or pushed into other applications for analysis and further use. Microsoft Dataverse is the common currency that enables the components of Microsoft Power Platform to work together. It is the foundation that enables the consolidation, display, and manipulation of data.
### AI Builder
Microsoft AI Builder is a Power Platform capability to speed up processes, predict outcomes and improve performance through AI insights. 
With AI Builder, you do not need coding or data science skills to access the power of AI. You can build custom models tailored to your needs, or choose a prebuilt model that is ready to use for many common business scenarios.

     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" /> 
    
  
  
Dataverse is intended to serve as your central data repository for business data, and you may already be using it. It is the backbone of many Microsoft Dynamics 365 solutions, including Field Service, Marketing, Customer Service, and Sales. It is also included as part of Power Apps and Power Automate, with native connectivity. Dataverse is also used by Microsoft Power Platform AI Builder and Portals features.

## Features

#### Security
Dataverse uses Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for authentication, allowing for restricted access and multi-factor authentication. It allows row and column-level authorisation and has extensive auditing capabilities.
#### Logic
Dataverse makes it simple to implement business logic at the data level. The same rules apply regardless of how a user interacts with the data. These rules could be about duplicate detection, business rules, workflows, or something else entirely.
#### Data
Dataverse empowers you to shape your data by enabling you to discover, model, validate, and report on it. This control ensures that your data looks the way you want it to, no matter how it is utilized.
#### Storage
Your physical data is stored on the Azure cloud via Dataverse. This cloud-based storage relieves you of the stress about where your data is stored and how it scales. All of these issues are taken care of for you.
#### Integration
Dataverse links in a variety of ways to help you meet your business goals. You can pull data in and out through APIs, webhooks, eventing, and data exports.

## Microsoft Dataverse
you can establish one or more cloud-based instances of a standardized database, With Microsoft Dataverse. Predefined tables and columns in the database store data that is common to almost all organizations and businesses. By adding new columns or tables, you can personalize and extend what is saved.

You can access your data saved in Microsoft Dataverse in a variety of ways. With technologies like Power Apps or Power Automate, you can work directly with the data. You can also connect to Microsoft Dataverse from any business solution using connectors and APIs.

## Dataverse Database
A Dataverse database is a single instance of Microsoft Dataverse that stores data in tables, which are a collection of standard and custom data structures. **A table** is a logical collection of rows for storing data. Many columns are used to manage distinct pieces of information about a single row in a table's rows.

To host data underlying your business solutions, you can build one or more database instances in Microsoft Dataverse. Each Microsoft Dataverse database starts with the same set of tables to hold data, but you can always extend and alter it to match your individual business requirements. This means you can share business solutions that use Microsoft Dataverse standard tables across your organization.

Large data collections and complicated data models are supported by the Dataverse database. Tables can hold millions of entries, and each instance of a Microsoft Dataverse database can be expanded to four terabytes of storage.

## Common Data Model 
The Common Data Model is a logical design that includes a set of open-sourced, standardized, extensible data tables and relationships published by Microsoft and its partners as part of the Open Data Initiative. The Common Data Model is built on a set of predefined tables, columns, semantic metadata, and relationships.

**The standard table design in a Microsoft Dataverse database is based upon an open data model standard: Common Data Model.**

You will be able to benefit from a rich ecosystem of solutions built by vendors using the Common Data Model. There is virtually no limit to how far a Microsoft Dataverse database can be extended.


## Table Types
A table is a logical structure containing rows and columns that represents a set of data.
- **Standard:** Standard tables in Dataverse include account, business unit, contact, task, and user tables. The majority of Dataverse's standard tables can be changed.
- **Managed:** Tables that have been imported into the environment as part of a managed solution and are not editable.
- **Custom:** Custom tables are unmanaged tables that are either imported from another system or generated from scratch in the Dataverse environment. 


## Columns
Within a row of a table, columns are a technique to store a single piece of data. You may think of them as an Excel column. Data types are assigned to columns, which means you can store data of a specific kind in a column that matches that data type.


## Relationships
You may develop an effective solution that can scale while retaining high performance by creating a table for each item and associating them to one another. You won't have to store repetitious data or support enormous rows with vast quantities of blank data if you split the data into multiple tables. Splitting the data into distinct tables will also make reporting much easier.
### Relationships between Tables
A relational connection exists between tables that are related to one another. Relationships between tables can take many forms, but the two most common are one-to-many and many-to-many, both of which Microsoft Dataverse supports.

Splitting data into different tables allows for a more effective and scalable solution design, but figuring out how to do so can be tricky. Fortunately, Microsoft Dataverse already has many of the tables that most businesses will want. Using standard tables and extending them will ensure that you are creating solutions around a tried-and-true, scalable method of storing data.

## Environments
In Microsoft Power Platform, environments are used to store, manage, and communicate your organization's business data, apps, and flows. You can supply one Microsoft Dataverse database per environment for use inside that environment. You may control user access, security settings, and the storage associated with a database in a Microsoft Dataverse system.

Setting up one environment for development, another for testing, and yet another for production use allows you to manage solution development and data storage across many environments. You can also create an atmosphere based on a certain region. You could, for example, create separate environments for Europe and Asia. Microsoft Dataverse will be installed in zero or one of these settings.

## Business rules
Business rules can be defined in Microsoft Dataverse. Business rules let you implement and retain business logic at the data layer rather than the application layer. Simply put, business rules you design in Microsoft Dataverse take effect regardless of where you interact with the data.

## Microsoft Power Platform admin center
You can utilize Microsoft Dataverse's administration tools to create new database instances or customize the access and functionality available to users of each Dataverse database instance.

The Microsoft Power Platform admin center has the majority of the administration settings you'll need. When trying to administer Microsoft Dataverse, the first thing you should do is look for administration settings.

To access the Admin Center, go to PowerApps and select Admin Center by clicking on the settings icon.
